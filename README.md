# PTB-Movie-Skeleton

This is a simple example script that uses Psychtoolbox to display movies on the right, center, and middle of the screen, display text, and ask for keyboard responses.

It's basically standard <a href = http://psychtoolbox.org/>Psychtoolbox</a> code, which I've wrapped up so that the experiment coder shouldn't have to deal with details like monitor size or video buffering.
The counterbalancing code/item lists are included as an example of how you might expand this code, and are Annemarie Kocab's.
